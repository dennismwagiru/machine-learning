# Machine-Learning

This repository contains all the machine learning algorithms I code. It also shows training and testing using available libraries such as scikit-learn, etc.

I will also attach mathematical solutions for the said algorithms

Hope you find what you are looking for!

### Models implemented till date
1. Linear Regression
   - 1-D Model

### Motivation

I have started learning Machine Learning using prebuilt algorithms and trying to implement the said algorithms myself.
