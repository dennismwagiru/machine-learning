# Machine-Learning

This repository contains all the machine learning algorithms I code. It also shows training and testing using available libraries such as scikit-learn, etc.

I will also attach mathematical solutions for the said algorithms

Hope you find what you are looking for!

### Models implemented till date
1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/dennismwagiru/machine-learning/tree/main/linear-regression)
   - [1-D Model](https://github.com/dennismwagiru/machine-learning/tree/main/linear-regression/1d-model)

### Motivation

I have started learning Machine Learning using prebuilt algorithms and trying to implement the said algorithms myself.
